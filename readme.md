/* Bootstrap Pictures Uploader */

This small snippet let user input a picture and upload it to a database in Base64, and see it.

I use bootstrap for the front-end side, and php and mysql in the server-side

I use the next frameworks / libraries:

- Bootstrap 3
- Canvas to BMP (https://github.com/epistemex/canvas-to-bmp)
- Cropper.js (http://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropper/)
